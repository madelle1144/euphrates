About (short origin story)
Euphrates Community Centre was community-tested for three years and officially registered in 2025. It was created by local leaders and volunteers to respond to persistent challenges in Dandora and neighbouring informal settlements — gaps in education for vulnerable children, limited access to vocational skills, and barriers to sustainable income. The Centre brings residents together with a practical, dignity-first approach: table banking for financial inclusion, vocational trainings to create jobs and income, and a community library to support lifelong learning.
